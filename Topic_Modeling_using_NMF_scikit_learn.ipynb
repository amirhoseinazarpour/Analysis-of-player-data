I have NEVER been to North Carolina and I have NEVER been a resident. I have filed a dispute twice through my credit bureaus but both times BB & T has claimed that this is an accurate loan. Which I wasn't aware of until today. I have tried to contact BB & T multiple times but I have never gotten through to a live person. I do n't drive and I have never owned a car before. I didn't have any knowledge of this account until I checked XXXXXXXX XXXX  and noticed it. I've tried twice to dispute it. Additionally I never received any bills or information about this account. This is my last resort in trying to remove this fraudulent loan off of my account.   \n",
              "1      In XXXX of 2019 I noticed a debt for {$620.00} on my credit which i believed was mine I thought speedy cash had bought one of my old debts and sold it to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and after several attempts of giving my full name, nothing came up in their system. I gave my social and the rep said the account popped up but DID NOT tell me that the account was under someone elses name and continued to let me make a payment. The payment was for {$120.00}. Confirmation number-XXXX. After realizing it was not my account, I called back to get my money back and inform them of the mistake. I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them. After contacting them i was again told that i can not get my money back. The issue im having is this representative at XXXX XXXX played blind to obvious fraud and let an innocent person make a payment on someone elses debt and i want my money back.   \n",

I gave my social and the rep said the account popped up but DID NOT tell me that the account was under someone elses name and continued to let me make a payment. The payment was for {$120.00}.

I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them. After contacting them i was again told that i can not get my money back.

This XXXX XXXX account has not ever been late and is currently an open account with the XXXX Domestic Relations Court. The account was unverifiable and now is being reported again inaccurately.\",\n          \"To Whom It May Concern, I know right now everything is about Coronavirus-19, but I hope I find a empathetic ear as I feel that my story is the same for a lot of American people. \\n\\nWe are fighting against foreclosure because of a minor mistake committed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX, which they corrected immediately when discovered. \\n\\nThe company administrating our real estate loan with XXXX XXXX  is Loan Care/XXXX out of Florida. Loan Care/XXXX   is the company that filed the foreclosure. \\n\\nIn XXXX when I checked our checking account, I found I was totally overdrawn. Loan Care has deducted {$1500.00} instead of the normal {$690.00} in XXXX and XXXX, XXXX which put my account into overdraft. My husband immediately called Loan Care and was advised not to make remittance until the error was corrected. After he called XXXX Countys Tax Office the error in the tax assessment did not reflect the Residential and Homestead discounts bringing my tax bill up to {$5100.00} from {$1700.00}. The County immediately refunded the difference to Loan Care. He, my husband, promptly advised Loan Care of the refund and tax adjustment.\\n\\nAgain we were told by Loan Care to hold off on payments until the  refund was logged and adjustments made. \\n\\nUntil XXXX, XXXX, my husband dealt with all of this, but on XX/XX/XXXX he had a XXXX XXXX and had XXXX  XXXX followed by a 5-day XXXX. I didnt know if he was going to get through this or not! All of a sudden I was alone and helpless with all of this. I went through all the paperwork from Loan Care as I wanted to fix the problem as quick as possible. \\n\\nIn XXXX I received a bill for {$9300.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX with a monthly premium of {$1500.00} ( no adjustments to tax change ). I didnt understand what was going on so I called Loan Care. Actually 4-5 times a day til mid-XXXX, but got a different person every time that told me something different which was no help. They said a lot, but didnt say anything! \\n\\nNot knowing what to do, I sent Loan Care a check for {$1800.00}. 13 which I calculated I owed. They returned my check without statement or instructions on how to proceed. So I started again my phone campaign of multiple calls daily to try and get some help. On XXXX I was told via phone that my case had gone to their attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX for foreclosure so I started to phone the attorney for help. \\nBesides phone calls I went to XXXX County Tax Office twice where I received the most information. They told me they had refunded the overage and showed me proof that Loan Care had received the monies, and that they had remedied the error promptly. They couldnt understand whats going on. \\n\\nAfter multiple phone calls XXXX XXXX told me they couldnt help me as they were Loan Cares attorney and that there was nothing they could do for me. All this was done while my husband was still in a XXXX! I feared that I might loose my husband and my home! I almost had a nervous breakdown so I sought medical help and was prescribed a XXXX. \\n\\nAfter a long search I found an attorney that was halfway affordable. I was advised to save the normal monthly payments, which I have, and just to wait til Loan Care made the next move. We were finally served with a Foreclosure Suit on XX/XX/XXXX and have been awaiting procedures since then. \\n\\nMy attorney has advised me that the outcome of the trial could result in me having to pay their attorney, paying ALL erroneous penalties with interest, and court costs. Through no fault of my own, the County admitted their error and corrected it, and because of the unethical business practices of Loan Care/XXXX I am in the nerve-wracking situation! \\n\\nBut it doesnt end here. On XXXX, XXXX, a water line broke in the upstairs bathroom which damaged the entire upstairs, penetrated the downstairs ceiling and wall, warped the hardwood flooring, and soaked the insulation in the crawlspace. Total estimated costs to restore our home to a safe and former condition might be close to {$30000.00}. \\n\\nIt is the insurance policy to include both parties, XXXX XXXX XXXX AND Loan CareXXXX, when payment exceeds {$6000.00}. Loan Care refuses to counter sign the checks. So we sit here with open walls and ceilings in a airborne and surface mold infested environment since XXXX, XXXX!! \\n\\nMy question is how is a company like this permitted to operate as they do without government control or public attention? Though many, many homes are lost through unethical foreclosure because of unaffordable legal representation or people get so frustrated that they give up ; why dont we hear about this? When you google LoancareXXXX, you find out that way to many people have to deal with the same or similar problems like us. \\n\\nI am XXXX years old and my husband is XXXX  years ; thank you Loan Care/XXXX so very, very much for ruining our retirement!!\",\n          \"Titan receivables is the name that this collector has changed to from a different case called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He has added an amount of {$2100.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX and now he calls it XXXX receivables. The file number matches XXXX and XXXX for a cost of {$2100.00} which is correct. Titan receivables is same account but with a fraudulent amount he has the same file number which makes my credit score in-depth XXXX plus dollars that is not supposed to be on my credit.

I didn't have any knowledge of this account until I checked XXXXXXXX XXXX  and noticed it. I've tried twice to dispute it. Additionally I never received any bills or information about this account.

              "1      In XXXX of 2019 I noticed a debt for {$620.00} on my credit which i believed was mine I thought speedy cash had bought one of my old debts and sold it to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and after several attempts of giving my full name, nothing came up in their system. I gave my social and the rep said the account popped up but DID NOT tell me that the account was under someone elses name and continued to let me make a payment. The payment was for {$120.00}. Confirmation number-XXXX. After realizing it was not my account, I called back to get my money back and inform them of the mistake. I was told i needed to mail them an FTC report and dispute letter to get my money back. I completed all of this and when i called again they said they transferred the account back to speedy cash for fraud review and I would need to contact them. After contacting them i was again told that i can not get my money back. The issue im having is this representative at XXXX XXXX played blind to obvious fraud and let an innocent person make a payment on someone elses debt and i want my money back.   \n",

However as of XX/XX/2020 the account reappeared on my credit report only now is listed as a closed account with a late payment in XX/XX/2020. This XXXX XXXX account has not ever been late and is currently an open account with the XXXX Domestic Relations Court. The account was unverifiable and now is being reported again inaccurately.\",\n          \"To Whom It May Concern, I know right now everything is about Coronavirus-19, but I hope I find a empathetic ear as I feel that my story is the same for a lot of American people. \\n\\nWe are fighting against foreclosure because of a minor mistake committed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX, which they corrected immediately when discovered. \\n\\nThe company administrating our real estate loan with XXXX XXXX  is Loan Care/XXXX out of Florida. Loan Care/XXXX   is the company that filed the foreclosure. \\n\\nIn XXXX when I checked our checking account, I found I was totally overdrawn. Loan Care has deducted {$1500.00} instead of the normal {$690.00} in XXXX and XXXX, XXXX which put my account into overdraft. My husband immediately called Loan Care and was advised not to make remittance until the error was corrected. After he called XXXX Countys Tax Office the error in the tax assessment did not reflect the Residential and Homestead discounts bringing my tax bill up to {$5100.00} from {$1700.00}. The County immediately refunded the difference to Loan Care. He, my husband, promptly advised Loan Care of the refund and tax adjustment.\\n\\nAgain we were told by Loan Care to hold off on payments until the  refund was logged and adjustments made. \\n\\nUntil XXXX, XXXX, my husband dealt with all of this, but on XX/XX/XXXX he had a XXXX XXXX and had XXXX  XXXX followed by a 5-day XXXX. I didnt know if he was going to get through this or not! All of a sudden I was alone and helpless with all of this. I went through all the paperwork from Loan Care as I wanted to fix the problem as quick as possible. \\n\\nIn XXXX I received a bill for {$9300.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX with a monthly premium of {$1500.00} ( no adjustments to tax change ). I didnt understand what was going on so I called Loan Care. Actually 4-5 times a day til mid-XXXX, but got a different person every time that told me something different which was no help. They said a lot, but didnt say anything! \\n\\nNot knowing what to do, I sent Loan Care a check for {$1800.00}. 13 which I calculated I owed. They returned my check without statement or instructions on how to proceed. So I started again my phone campaign of multiple calls daily to try and get some help. On XXXX I was told via phone that my case had gone to their attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX for foreclosure so I started to phone the attorney for help. \\nBesides phone calls I went to XXXX County Tax Office twice where I received the most information. They told me they had refunded the overage and showed me proof that Loan Care had received the monies, and that they had remedied the error promptly. They couldnt understand whats going on. \\n\\nAfter multiple phone calls XXXX XXXX told me they couldnt help me as they were Loan Cares attorney and that there was nothing they could do for me. All this was done while my husband was still in a XXXX! I feared that I might loose my husband and my home! I almost had a nervous breakdown so I sought medical help and was prescribed a XXXX. \\n\\nAfter a long search I found an attorney that was halfway affordable. I was advised to save the normal monthly payments, which I have, and just to wait til Loan Care made the next move. We were finally served with a Foreclosure Suit on XX/XX/XXXX and have been awaiting procedures since then. \\n\\nMy attorney has advised me that the outcome of the trial could result in me having to pay their attorney, paying ALL erroneous penalties with interest, and court costs. Through no fault of my own, the County admitted their error and corrected it, and because of the unethical business practices of Loan Care/XXXX I am in the nerve-wracking situation! \\n\\nBut it doesnt end here. On XXXX, XXXX, a water line broke in the upstairs bathroom which damaged the entire upstairs, penetrated the downstairs ceiling and wall, warped the hardwood flooring, and soaked the insulation in the crawlspace. Total estimated costs to restore our home to a safe and former condition might be close to {$30000.00}. \\n\\nIt is the insurance policy to include both parties, XXXX XXXX XXXX AND Loan CareXXXX, when payment exceeds {$6000.00}. Loan Care refuses to counter sign the checks. So we sit here with open walls and ceilings in a airborne and surface mold infested environment since XXXX, XXXX!! \\n\\nMy question is how is a company like this permitted to operate as they do without government control or public attention? Though many, many homes are lost through unethical foreclosure because of unaffordable legal representation or people get so frustrated that they give up ; why dont we hear about this? When you google LoancareXXXX, you find out that way to many people have to deal with the same or similar problems like us. \\n\\nI am XXXX years old and my husband is XXXX  years ; thank you Loan Care/XXXX so very, very much for ruining our retirement!!\",\n          \"Titan receivables is the name that this collector has changed to from a different case called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He has added an amount of {$2100.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX and now he calls it XXXX receivables. The file number matches XXXX and XXXX for a cost of {$2100.00} which is correct. Titan receivables is same account but with a fraudulent amount he has the same file number which makes my credit score in-depth XXXX plus dollars that is not supposed to be on my credit. The odd {$1800.00} it's from a case from 2012 bails bondsman that the statue of limitations is up and he changed the name to add it to my account anyway and put it under Titan receivables look at the file numbers they are the same except for he is fraudulently putting money on my credit that does not belong there\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Product\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Vehicle loan or lease\",\n          \"Debt collection\",\n          \"Student loan\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Company\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2197,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Apothaker & Associates, PC\",\n          \"FIRST GUARANTY MORTGAGE CORP\",\n          \"NCB Management Services Inc.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I have also asked them to not call me or anyone associated with me. They have called my mother in law way too many times asking for my partner. They have called my partner multiple times asking for me. I'm not sure what kind of operation is being ran there, but it needs to stop. I'm giving notice to cease all contact with me or anyone else except the creditor about this claimed debt. Only contact me in writing, not by phone. Thank you.   \n",
              "34878  I have called several times, even spoken to a manager to try to clear this matter up and am not able to resolve it. \\n\\nCiti is claiming there is fraudulent activity on my account, at which they are requesting that I call in to resolve it. I have spoken to about five or six of their representatives, trying to resolve it. They are determining that it is inconclusive, and they are unable to move any further by phone. \\n\\nAt this particular time, they have \" frozen '' my spending. There is a statement on my page that will not print out that tells me charges to my account may be limited. When I try to print it, it does not show on that page because of the formatting that they have used on their web site. \\n\\nI have not received any correspondence from them in over a month. I am writing to them today to request that they close my account and apply the balance toward what I owe, because I am not able to use the account. \\n\\nFor some reason, I made a payment on the XXXX of XXXX and that payment has been cancelled. \\n\\nEvery time I have tried to contact Citi, they give some reason or another as to why we can not resolve the matter. I have asked them what do I need to do to resolve it, but they are unable to provide a resolution. \\n\\nThe problem is that I have changed my phone number. My address is still the same, but I have been staying with my sister temporarily off-and-on since her mild XXXX in XXXX. I refuse to change my address to hers, even though I have noticed that my creditors have done so against my will. I told them to keep it as my temporary address, before advising others not to change it at all. I am back and forth between her house and my mailing address listed on this account. \\n\\nMy problem is with their fraud department. They are unable to give me a solid reason why my account is tagged for fraud. They have failed to send me notification stating steps to verify my information, and to notify me of any results from an \" investigation '' that they are having or holding on my account. I have been unable to use my account since XXXX. \\n\\nThe last time I called before my account was \" flagged '', I was trying to make a payment by phone. My phone number had changed, and I verified my information. Something XXXX me off and I hung up the phone ( I believe they asked me to enter my full credit card number ), which is usually unusual when you verify the information. When I called back, they did the same thing - at which I explained that I was driving. Almost every time I called, I was driving. I was not about to risk getting into a wreck to get a credit card out, but was willing to verify all of my other information. \\n\\nSame scenario, repeatedly. I was trying to make a payment, and when I decided not to on that phone call and hung up, it was only then that I mysteriously received information saying my account had been flagged. Prior to this, the only charges that had been made on the account were to make my XXXX XXXX payments, so there are no indications of fraud on this account. \\n\\nNow that my account has been flagged, I would like my money back. This is a secured card, where I invested my money with Citi and they have locked me from using the card. I have made 2 payments since then, and now, like once before, for some reason, one of my payments didn't go through. \\n\\nNot only that, my account disappeared from their system for a little over 48 hours that I had used prior on the account. They could not process a payment on this account, so I had to use my debit card tied to this account. I have no idea why they could not use this account. However, it appears that the same thing has been going on, because a recent payment that I made has been cancelled. I am not sure why this time, but they have accessed a late fee on my account. \\n\\nAt this point, I am tired of Citi. I had a good relationship with them when I was in college, and they were called Citibank or Citigroup before they branched off into Citi. \\n\\nMy secured account is set to mature in XXXX ; however, I just want my money back. I want them to take the money that I owe them and pay off my account, and say that it is paid, and closed at customer request. This is too much headache to go through for a secured credit card. \\n\\nIf they have rules surrounding verification of my account, and new phone numbers, they should have just tried to issue a refund of my monies ... and let my account go ... \\n\\nI will pay the balance of {$7.00}, once they issue a credit to my card. But I am done with Citi ... I will never bank with them by myriad of choice again.   \n",

I get online where they direct us to for live chat which responds to \" online chat not available.

I have spoken to about five or six of their representatives, trying to resolve it. They are determining that it is inconclusive, and they are unable to move any further by phone. \\n\\nAt this particular time, they have \" frozen '' my spending. There is a statement on my page that will not print out that tells me charges to my account may be limited. When I try to print it, it does not show on that page because of the formatting that they have used on their web site. \\n\\nI have not received any correspondence from them in over a month. I am writing to them today to request that they close my account and apply the balance toward what I owe, because I am not able to use the account. \\n\\nFor some reason, I made a payment on the XXXX of XXXX and that payment has been cancelled. \\n\\nEvery time I have tried to contact Citi, they give some reason or another as to why we can not resolve the matter. I have asked them what do I need to do to resolve it, but they are unable to provide a resolution. \\n\\nThe problem is that I have changed my phone number. My address is still the same, but I have been staying with my sister temporarily off-and-on since her mild XXXX in XXXX. I refuse to change my address to hers, even though I have noticed that my creditors have done so against my will. I told them to keep it as my temporary address, before advising others not to change it at all. I am back and forth between her house and my mailing address listed on this account. \\n\\nMy problem is with their fraud department. They are unable to give me a solid reason why my account is tagged for fraud. They have failed to send me notification stating steps to verify my information, and to notify me of any results from an \" investigation '' that they are having or holding on my account. I have been unable to use my account since XXXX. \\n\\nThe last time I called before my account was \" flagged '', I was trying to make a payment by phone. My phone number had changed, and I verified my information. Something XXXX me off and I hung up the phone ( I believe they asked me to enter my full credit card number ), which is usually unusual when you verify the information. When I called back, they did the same thing - at which I explained that I was driving. Almost every time I called, I was driving. I was not about to risk getting into a wreck to get a credit card out, but was willing to verify all of my other information. \\n\\nSame scenario, repeatedly. I was trying to make a payment, and when I decided not to on that phone call and hung up, it was only then that I mysteriously received information saying my account had been flagged. Prior to this, the only charges that had been made on the account were to make my XXXX XXXX payments, so there are no indications of fraud on this account. \\n\\nNow that my account has been flagged, I would like my money back. This is a secured card, where I invested my money with Citi and they have locked me from using the card. I have made 2 payments since then, and now, like once before, for some reason, one of my payments didn't go through. \\n\\nNot only that, my account disappeared from their system for a little over 48 hours that I had used prior on the account. They could not process a payment on this account, so I had to use my debit card tied to this account. I have no idea why they could not use this account. However, it appears that the same thing has been going on, because a recent payment that I made has been cancelled. I am not sure why this time, but they have accessed a late fee on my account. \\n\\nAt this point, I am tired of Citi. I had a good relationship with them when I was in college, and they were called Citibank or Citigroup before they branched off into Citi. \\n\\nMy secured account is set to mature in XXXX ; however, I just want my money back. I want them to take the money that I owe them and pay off my account, and say that it is paid, and closed at customer request. This is too much headache to go through for a secured credit card. \\n\\nIf they have rules surrounding verification of my account, and new phone numbers, they should have just tried to issue a refund of my monies ... and let my account go ... \\n\\nI will pay the balance of {$7.00}, once they issue a credit to my card. But I am done with Citi ... I will never bank with them by myriad of choice again.</td>\n",

I was assured at that time the account was closed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Barclays dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating that my account had been closed because it was more than 90 days past due. I immediately called the company and was told there had been an {$8.00} charge placed on my account on XX/XX/XXXX, ONE MONTH AFTER I WAS TOLD THE ACCOUNT HAD BEEN CLOSED. I had not received one billing statement in the mail between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX notifying me of an outstanding balance or late fees. As my credit card history shows, I paid my credit card monthly and had been in good standing with Barclaycard. When I spoke with the Barclaycard representative on the phone, I was given a case number and told they would pursue this as a dispute ( rather than a fraudulent charge ). I received a letter from Barclaycard dated XX/XX/XXXX with the case number for the dispute saying they would let me know when they had completed their review. Then I received another letter from Barclaycard dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that they were unable to obtain credit for the fraudulent charge because it was \\\" beyond timeframes to assist. '' The day I received that letter XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, I phoned the magazine company myself about the fraudulent charge, and they agreed to remove the {$8.00} charge from my account within 3 business days. I called Barclaycard on XX/XX/XXXX to verify that the charge had been removed and was told that the original {$8.00} charge had been credited and that all interest and fees incurred as a result of that charge ( which by now totaled > {$130.00} XXXX would be removed from the account and that the account would remain closed. TWO DAYS LATER, on XX/XX/XXXX, I was quite surprised and shocked to receive an email from Barclaycard about making a payment when I had been told 2 days prior that the account had a XXXX   balance and was closed. I called Barclaycard again on XX/XX/XXXX and am now being told that they will not remove the late fees and interest charged to this account since XXXX because it was greater than 3 months. I refuse to pay interest and late fees for a fraudulent {$8.00} charge that has now been removed from an account that was supposed to be closed. The delinquency charges on my account should lawfully be removed and this information should be reported to the credit bureau for the following reasons : 1 ) The charge was made after the account had been closed. 2 ) I did not receive a billing statement notifying me of these charges. 3 ) A Barclaycard representative agreed on XX/XX/XXXX to remove all charges/late fees but then failed to do so.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Product\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Debt collection\",\n          \"Credit card or prepaid card\",\n          \"Student loan\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Company\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1949,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Financial Management & Associates, Inc.\",\n          \"SFS, Inc\",\n          \"Harvard Collections, LLC\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

On XX/XX/2019, I attempted to deposit a check into my account and I received a message stating that I was over my monthly mobile deposit limit. I was confused because it was the first of the month and I had not deposited any checks since the previous month. I called BB &amp; T and they said that I couldnt deposit checks into business accounts via the mobile app even though I had done that before. \\n\\nI was instructed to open a personal account, into which I could deposit checks via the mobile app. I was told that if I opened the account online I would have immediate access, that I could link my personal and business accounts, and immediately be able to transfer money between them. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I opened my personal account online. Though I successfully opened online, I did not have online access as I had been promised. Because I was traveling in an area where there were no BB &amp; T branches, I could not go into a branch until XX/XX/2019. In the intervening time, my business account became overdrawn. I had the money in my personal account to bring it back into the black, but BB &amp; T could not make the transfer until I went into a branch. During this time, I incurred an astonishing {$320.00} in overdraft fees in my business account because I had no way of transferring money between the two accounts. \\n\\nWhen I went into the branch, I met with XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX County, Florida. She investigated the accounts and told me she would link them and that I would have online access in XXXX hours. The online access still never material, I was not able to transfer money and I received an additional {$36.00} overdraft fee. This brought the total to {$360.00} in overdraft fees. \\n\\nI had only opened the second account on BB &amp; Ts advice ; I could have had my customer send a bank wire directly into business account in the first week of XXXX to keep the account positive. My TOTAL deposits between the two accounts was always positive. \\n\\nI requested a refund and was told they would not refund any of the fees.</td>\n",

              "      <td>I first applied for the Fedloan Serving program in XXXX in hopes of getting loan forgiveness since I've been paying on my student loans since late XXXX or early XXXX and I have been a public servant since XXXX, XXXX. I have never missed a payment to any of the various loan companies that owned my loans. The Fedloan Program turned me down in XXXX, saying my loans, which were originally Federal Stafford Loans, did not qualify me for the Program. In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program. My loan payments went down to $ XXXX/month for the first year. In XXXX, XXXX, Fedloan Servicing informed me via email that I needed to recertify my \" income-driven repayment plan. Their customer service helped me submit the form XXXX XXXX ) via the internet and it involved the IRS. For reasons I don't understand, Fedloan is now increasing my monthly payments to {$380.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 60 % increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan regarding this issue. The customer service person suggested I ask for a recalculation and provide pay-stubs rather than IRS information. On the same call, I was transferred to a second agent who listened to my concern and suggested I get out of the Fedloan Program since I really didn't qualify for it anyway and I could save money by going to a regular payment plan with a different servicer such as XXXX which had serviced my loan previously. I feel like I've been miss-lead by the Fedloan Serving Program and by Mr. XXXX XXXX, the case manager at XXXX XXXX ( http : //www.nexum-servicing.com ). After receiving my {$690.00}, I was never able to talk to XXXX on the phone again. He had convinced me I could save money with Fedloan and he told me my payments would go down to {$0.00} when I retire from State Service in XXXX. He told me I would receive loan forgiveness once my payments went to {$0.00}. I have concluded his advise was incorrect and or miss-leading. I regret having my loan transferred to the Fedloan Program because its representatives have indicated I will not receive loan forgiveness for my 20 years of public service. I am very concerned about the cost of my student loan debt, especially since I intend to retire from State service in XXXX. I am also concerned about how I will be able to afford these student loan payments once I am receiving a pension. I am also very disappointed that I haven't been able to \" qualify '' for loan forgiveness based on my long years of public service. I think this whole Fedloan Program is complete scam and I have been duped.</td>\n",

              "30060  I have a business checking account at BB & T. On XX/XX/2019, I attempted to deposit a check into my account and I received a message stating that I was over my monthly mobile deposit limit. I was confused because it was the first of the month and I had not deposited any checks since the previous month. I called BB & T and they said that I couldnt deposit checks into business accounts via the mobile app even though I had done that before. \\n\\nI was instructed to open a personal account, into which I could deposit checks via the mobile app. I was told that if I opened the account online I would have immediate access, that I could link my personal and business accounts, and immediately be able to transfer money between them. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I opened my personal account online. Though I successfully opened online, I did not have online access as I had been promised. Because I was traveling in an area where there were no BB & T branches, I could not go into a branch until XX/XX/2019. In the intervening time, my business account became overdrawn. I had the money in my personal account to bring it back into the black, but BB & T could not make the transfer until I went into a branch. During this time, I incurred an astonishing {$320.00} in overdraft fees in my business account because I had no way of transferring money between the two accounts. \\n\\nWhen I went into the branch, I met with XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX County, Florida. She investigated the accounts and told me she would link them and that I would have online access in XXXX hours. The online access still never material, I was not able to transfer money and I received an additional {$36.00} overdraft fee. This brought the total to {$360.00} in overdraft fees. \\n\\nI had only opened the second account on BB & Ts advice ; I could have had my customer send a bank wire directly into business account in the first week of XXXX to keep the account positive. My TOTAL deposits between the two accounts was always positive. \\n\\nI requested a refund and was told they would not refund any of the fees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ...

To my knowledge I didnt owe a payment because the account wasnt being used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ...

              "20993  I first applied for the Fedloan Serving program in XXXX in hopes of getting loan forgiveness since I've been paying on my student loans since late XXXX or early XXXX and I have been a public servant since XXXX, XXXX. I have never missed a payment to any of the various loan companies that owned my loans. The Fedloan Program turned me down in XXXX, saying my loans, which were originally Federal Stafford Loans, did not qualify me for the Program. In XXXX, XXXX, I was solicited by XXXX XXXX   and told I could get into this program to reduce my loan payments. I was charged {$690.00} by XXXX XXXX to get me into the Fedloan Serving program. My loan payments went down to $ XXXX/month for the first year. In XXXX, XXXX, Fedloan Servicing informed me via email that I needed to recertify my \" income-driven repayment plan. Their customer service helped me submit the form XXXX XXXX ) via the internet and it involved the IRS. For reasons I don't understand, Fedloan is now increasing my monthly payments to {$380.00}, effective XX/XX/XXXX. This is a 60 % increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan regarding this issue. The customer service person suggested I ask for a recalculation and provide pay-stubs rather than IRS information. On the same call, I was transferred to a second agent who listened to my concern and suggested I get out of the Fedloan Program since I really didn't qualify for it anyway and I could save money by going to a regular payment plan with a different servicer such as XXXX which had serviced my loan previously. I feel like I've been miss-lead by the Fedloan Serving Program and by Mr. XXXX XXXX, the case manager at XXXX XXXX ( http : //www.nexum-servicing.com ). After receiving my {$690.00}, I was never able to talk to XXXX on the phone again. He had convinced me I could save money with Fedloan and he told me my payments would go down to {$0.00} when I retire from State Service in XXXX. He told me I would receive loan forgiveness once my payments went to {$0.00}. I have concluded his advise was incorrect and or miss-leading. I regret having my loan transferred to the Fedloan Program because its representatives have indicated I will not receive loan forgiveness for my 20 years of public service. I am very concerned about the cost of my student loan debt, especially since I intend to retire from State service in XXXX. I am also concerned about how I will be able to afford these student loan payments once I am receiving a pension. I am also very disappointed that I haven't been able to \" qualify '' for loan forgiveness based on my long years of public service. I think this whole Fedloan Program is complete scam and I have been duped.  ...  AES/PHEAA                        \n",
              "53     On several occasions ( XXXX ) I have tried to reach someone in costumer service today XX/XX/2020 I tried again to get through and was on hold for over 20 minutes and hung up. \\n\\n3 Years ago I have made no more than {$600.00} in purchases, and while making payments on my account with a {$9000.00} limit the interest charges are deducted from the credit limit and the interest was based on the balance each month. this left my interest and charge fess higher than my monthly payment which amounted to around {$240.00} each month. \\n\\nIn all of this time the interest was so big that it completely eat up the limit balance on the card, which left in me in a vicious cycle of never paying down the money owed. with in 2 years I was able to get the balance down {$2000.00} and I asked Walmart Capital One to reduce the balance down. Now it is back up to the high bank fees and interest charges that have again gone beyond what I can afford monthly the {$240.00}. This is a unfair and infantile game that is forced on me as an consumer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ...
